# Photo-Gallery-
A Photo Gallery using jQuery for a travel photo sharing site.

## Description:
When the document is loaded, I have made an AJAX call, download the data.json file (it contains an array of image objects) and display images on your html page. When the user hovers over the image, it shows the larger version of the image along with the caption. For pop-up window that shows larger image, I have used Bootstrapâ€™s modal component.
